[32m+[m[32mFor example, taking the mean of a numeric vector is typically a fast[m
 operation. However, for a very long vector, it may take too long to[m
 compute the mean, especially if it has to be computed repeatedly (e.g.[m
 in a loop). If the contents of a vector are not changing, it may make[m
 sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, it[m
 can be looked up in the cache rather than recomputed. In this[m
